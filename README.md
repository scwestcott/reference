# reference

## Introduction
A collection of reference notes I've generated while learning and practicing to 
be a software developer. I've created these documents both to help me cement the
things I'm learning, and to make it faster for me to reference those 
things I've learned in a familiar environment that I created, rather than 
trying my luck at Googling.
