# reference

## Introduction
A collection of reference notes I've generated while learning and practicing to 
be a software developer. I've created these documents both to help me cement the
things I'm learning, and to more quickly reference those 
things in a familiar environment that I created, rather than 
jumping down a Google rabbit hole when I'm trying to remember how to do something.

Using GitHub to host my notes not only puts them in a central repository for
me to reference anywhere, it also makes me regulalry use and practice with:

1. Git
1. GitHub
1. Markdown
1. Text Editor

Plus, I like the higher standard I target when my stuff is public, even if I'm
the only one likley to ever look at it. :smile:
